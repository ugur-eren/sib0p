# Sib0p

> ⚠️ Don't judge my coding skills from this project. It's first version was made 4 years ago. I've learned a lot since then. Take a look at the [**SveJ**](https://github.com/ugur-eren/svej-app) project for the new version of this app. ⚠️

**Sib0p** (now renamed as [**SveJ**](https://github.com/ugur-eren/svej-app)) was a social media platform I've worked on years ago. I've created the designs, developed the app and the backend. It had more than 50k downloads world-wide. It was a fun project to work on and I've learned a lot from it. Since I'm re-creating the app in a more modern way, I've decided to also open-source the old version.

It was one of the first projects I've built, so it is in a reaaallly bad shape. No global state management tool, no tests, no proper api structure, no proper folder structure, no proper code style, no proper anything. I've learned a lot since then and I'm trying to apply what I've learned to the new [**SveJ**](https://github.com/ugur-eren/svej-app) app.

It's backend was written in PHP, and it's much more worse than this app, so I won't be open-sourcing it. I'll be creating a new backend in NodeJS for the new app.

I don't think anyone would want to run this app, but if you want to, good luck. I'm not sure if it will even run without the backend. I haven't even tried it.
